I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in the [ACM Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home). My research interest lies in designing efficient robot learning system, reinforcement learning and imitation learning.

I am currently a member of [RHOS Lab](https://mvig-rhos.com/) coadvised by Prof. [Cewu Lu](https://www.mvig.org/) and Prof. [Yonglu Li](https://dirtyharrylyl.github.io/).

Feel free to contact me in any possible way.

Hobbies
===

Beside research interest, I am always open to new experience and activity.

I'm fond of a wide variety of sports like soccer and basketball. Reading and cooking also largely intrigues me.

I was trained as a professional athlete in my junior years and that experience meant a lot to me.
