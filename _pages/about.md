I'm Li Xinran, a third year undergraduate student majoring in Statistics at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (2022-2026). My research interests lie in statistical modeling, data analysis, machine learning, and their applications in real-world problems.

I am passionate about applying statistical methods to solve complex problems in various fields, including public health, education, and finance. Through my undergraduate research projects, I have gained experience in Bayesian statistics, time series analysis, and predictive modeling.

Feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions about my research!

## Hobbies

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy exploring new experiences and activities.

I'm particularly fond of data visualization and creating interactive dashboards to tell compelling stories with data. I also enjoy reading about the latest developments in statistics and machine learning, as well as participating in data science competitions.

In my free time, I like to practice yoga and go hiking, which help me maintain a good work-life balance. I also enjoy cooking and trying new recipes from different cultures.
