This undergraduate research project focuses on applying statistical methods and machine learning techniques to analyze COVID-19 pandemic data. By examining infection rates, mortality statistics, and demographic factors, we developed predictive models to understand disease spread patterns and inform public health policies.

## Key Contributions

1. **Data Analysis**: Conducted comprehensive statistical analysis of COVID-19 datasets from multiple countries
2. **Model Development**: Implemented time series forecasting models to predict infection trends
3. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards to visualize pandemic data and trends

## Technical Stack

- **Statistical Software**: R, Python
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Time Series**: ARIMA, LSTM models

## Research Outcomes

- Completed comprehensive statistical analysis of global COVID-19 data
- Developed predictive models with 85% accuracy for short-term forecasting
- Presented findings at undergraduate research symposium
- Received recognition for outstanding undergraduate research
