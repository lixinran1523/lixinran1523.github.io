This research project focuses on developing an automated medical image diagnosis system based on deep learning. By analyzing large amounts of CT scan images, we trained a convolutional neural network model that can accurately identify and classify various diseases. The research has achieved significant results in improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy.

## Key Contributions

1. **Model Innovation**: Proposed a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that improves the model's ability to identify subtle lesions
2. **Dataset Construction**: Built a large-scale medical image dataset containing 10,000+ annotated samples
3. **Performance Enhancement**: Compared to traditional methods, diagnostic accuracy improved by 15% and processing speed increased by 3x
