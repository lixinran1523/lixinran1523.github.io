This undergraduate research project focuses on analyzing student performance data in online learning environments. By applying statistical modeling techniques, we identified key factors that influence academic success and developed predictive models to help improve educational outcomes.

## Research Content

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered comprehensive student performance data from online learning platforms
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Applied regression analysis and hypothesis testing to identify significant factors
3. **Model Development**: Built predictive models using machine learning algorithms
4. **Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards to visualize learning patterns and trends

## Technical Implementation

- **Statistical Software**: R, Python
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Scipy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau

## Project Outcomes

- Analyzed data from 10,000+ students across multiple courses
- Identified key factors affecting student performance (engagement time, assignment completion, etc.)
- Developed predictive models with 78% accuracy for performance prediction
- Presented findings at undergraduate research conference
