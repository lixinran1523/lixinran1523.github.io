This project is dedicated to developing an intelligent question answering system that can understand Chinese semantics and conduct multi-turn dialogues. By combining pre-trained language models with knowledge graphs, the system can provide accurate and coherent answers.

## Research Content

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Chinese semantic representation learning based on BERT model
2. **Knowledge Fusion**: Integration of external knowledge graphs with language models
3. **Dialogue Management**: Context understanding and state management for multi-turn dialogues
4. **System Optimization**: Model compression and inference acceleration

## Technical Implementation

- **Pre-trained Models**: BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-2
- **Knowledge Graph**: Neo4j, SPARQL
- **Dialogue System**: Rasa, Dialogflow
- **Evaluation Metrics**: BLEU, ROUGE, Human Evaluation

## Project Outcomes

- Built a Chinese Q&A dataset containing 500,000 question-answer pairs
- Developed a complete intelligent Q&A system prototype
- Achieved SOTA performance on multiple benchmark tests
- Received best paper nomination at international conference
