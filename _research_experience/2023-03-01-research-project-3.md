This undergraduate research project focuses on applying Bayesian statistical methods to financial risk assessment. By analyzing historical market data and incorporating uncertainty quantification, we developed models to predict market volatility and assess investment risks.

## Research Focus

1. **Bayesian Modeling**: Applied Bayesian inference to financial time series data
2. **Risk Assessment**: Developed Value-at-Risk (VaR) models using Bayesian methods
3. **Volatility Prediction**: Implemented GARCH models with Bayesian parameter estimation
4. **Portfolio Optimization**: Applied Bayesian optimization techniques to portfolio selection

## Technical Architecture

- **Statistical Software**: R, Python, Stan
- **Bayesian Methods**: MCMC sampling, Variational inference
- **Financial Data**: Yahoo Finance API, Quandl
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Key Innovations

- Implemented hierarchical Bayesian models for multi-asset risk assessment
- Developed adaptive volatility models using Bayesian updating
- Created interactive risk visualization dashboards

## Project Outcomes

- Analyzed 5 years of historical data from major stock indices
- Developed risk models with improved accuracy compared to traditional methods
- Created comprehensive risk assessment framework for portfolio management
- Presented findings at undergraduate statistics conference
